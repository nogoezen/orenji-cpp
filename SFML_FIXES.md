# SFML 3 Compatibility Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to ensure compatibility with SFML 3 as part of the upgrade process.

## Completed Fixes

### Event Handling

We've updated the event handling code in several files to match the new SFML 3 API:

- **CameraExample.cpp**
  - Changed `sf::VideoMode(width, height)` to `sf::VideoMode({width, height})`
  - Updated event handling from `window.pollEvent(event)` to `const auto event = window.pollEvent()`
  - Changed event type checking from `event.type == sf::Event::Closed` to `event->is<sf::Event::Closed>()`
  - Updated key event handling to use `const auto *keyEvent = event->getIf<sf::Event::KeyPressed>()`
  - Fixed keyboard key references to use `sf::Keyboard::Key::X` format

- **ParticleDemo.cpp** 
  - Updated event handling similar to above
  - Fixed mouse position access to use `mouseEvent->position.x/y` instead of direct x/y members

- **GameMapExample.cpp**
  - Removed hardcoded SFML type definitions
  - Updated to the SFML 3 event handling pattern
  - Fixed event type checking and key handling

### Vertex Creation

- Fixed vertex creation in CameraExample.cpp where constructors with parameters are no longer supported
- Now we create vertices, then set their properties individually

## Successful Tests

The following simple test programs were created and successfully compiled to verify SFML 3 compatibility:

- `SimpleWindow.cpp` - Basic window with event handling
- `SimpleWindowWithBox.cpp` - Moving box with collision detection

## Remaining Issues

### Box2D Integration

- Box2D library needs to be built separately before the build.bat script runs
- We've updated build.bat to handle this, but it requires CMake and proper setup

### Component Implementation Files

- Several examples require implementation files that need to be compiled and linked:
  - Camera.cpp for CameraExample
  - ParticleSystem.cpp for ParticleDemo
  - GameMap.cpp and TiledMapLoader.cpp for GameMapExample

### Integration with CMake

- The full project should be built with CMake to properly handle all dependencies
- Our fixes are temporary to make example compilation work

## Build Instructions

1. Install CMake and add it to your PATH
2. Download Box2D and extract it to lib/box2d
3. Run build.bat which will:
   - Build Box2D if possible
   - Configure and build the main project
   - Build examples

For manual compilation of tests:
```bash
g++ -o build/bin/SimpleWindow.exe tests/SimpleWindow.cpp -I./include -I./lib/sfml/include -L./lib/sfml/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```
